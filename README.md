A simple Arduino app that turning on and off a heater (e.g., gas stove) based on the current temperature & time, 
versus a target temperature that varies hour by hour.

Currently setup to anticipate an Adafruit MicroView Ardunio, with attached DS1307 RTC, 
with Dallas DS18B20 thermometer soldered in, and a 4 button switch that enables 
temporarily (until next time period) altering the current temperature setting.
